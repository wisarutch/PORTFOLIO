I found out about this career relatively recently and I liked it so much.I am always**positive**,**flexible**,**fast learner** **and love learning new things.**  Additionally, **I have a keen interest in continuously developing skills,I have also started learning test automation and learning about new technologies.** I have the skills of exploratory testing, testing of websites and mobile applications,  writing test cases ,writing scenarios, reporting defects and creating test reports. I know how to use SQL, Postman ,VS Code , GIT , JMeter and  Automated Testing  – Selenium,Appium, Robot Framework  basics.
